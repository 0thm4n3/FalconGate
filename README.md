# FalconGate

Cyber attacks are on the raise. Hacker and cyber criminals are continuosly improving their methods and building new tools and Malware with the purpose of hacking your network, spying on you and stealing valuable data. Recently a new business model has become popular among hackers: the use of Ransomware to encrypt your data and ask for a ransom to unlock it. These attacks have extended also to the Internet of Things (IoT) devices since many of them are vulnerable by design and hackers can leverage them to compromise other devices in your network or launch DDoS attacks towards other targets. Traditionally securing a network against such attacks has been an expensive item which could be afforded just by medium to large companies. With FalconGate we're aiming to change this and bring "out of the box" security for free to people, small businesses and anyone else in need.

FalconGate it's an open source gateway which can protect your home devices against Malware attacks like Ransomeware. It detects and alerts on hacker intrusions on your home network as well as other devices missbehaving and attacking targets within your network or in the Internet.

## Getting Started

FalconGate was built on top of other open source software so it has multiple dependencies which must be configured correctly for it to work. The fastest way to get FalconGate up and running it's to download one of our images for Raspberry Pi or Banana Pi from the links below and install it in your own device.


### Supported Platforms

Currently FalconGate has been succesfully tested and implemented on Raspbian Jessie Lite for Raspberry Pi and Banana Pi.

### Prerequisites

FalconGate has a number of software dependencies:

- Bro IDS
- Python 2.7
- Nginx
- Dnsmasq
- Exim
- PHP

It depends also on several Python modules (see requirements.txt file for details)
